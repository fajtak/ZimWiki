- measure the same positions also for PS-based scintillator with two and three fibers on the top (IEAP).
- two Hamamatsu SMD type SiPMs left at IEAP for additional tests and studies (IEAP).
- two Senzl SiPMs sent to CERN for additional studies (CERN).
- measure deltaT with two Hamamatsu SiPMs (CERN).
- measure deltaT with really small triggering scintillator (2x2 cm^2) hitting exactly the fiber (3 fiber version) (CERN, IEAP).
