Created Úterý 20 říjen 2015

Data - stream of snapshots

====== The Three states ======

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: commited, modified, and staged.
	- commited = stored in your local database
	- modified = filed is changed and have not committed yet
	- staged = you have marked a modified file to go into your next commit snapshot
	

====== Three main sections ======

Git directory - metadata abd object database is stored here
The working directory - current version of the project
Staging area - file (in Git directory), that stores infromation about what will go into your next commit.

====== Git  basics ======

===== Getting a Git Repository =====
1) take an existing project or directory and imports it into Git - **git init**
2) clone an existing Git repository from another server - **git clone https://... name_of_folder**

===== Recording Changes to the Repository =====
Files in your working directory can be **tracked** or **untracked**
**Tracked **files can be unmodified, modified, staged.

==== Checking the Status of your Files ====
How to check status - **git status**
Short version - **git status -s **

==== Tracking New Files ====
To begin tracking new files - **git add file_name**

==== Staging Modified Files ====
The same as for new files - **git add file_name**

==== Ignoring Files ====
Files which you do not want to be shown - **you should create .gitignore {*.[oa],*~}**

==== Viewing Staged and Unstaged Changes ====
If you want to know what changed exactly - **git diff / git diff --staged**
Answer to the two questions: What have you changed but not yet staged and what have you staged that you are about to commit.

==== Commiting Your Changes ====
With prepared staging area - **git commit**
Nebo - **git commit -m "Name of commit"**

==== Skipping the Staging Area ====
Commit all tracked files - **git commit -a**

==== Removing Files ====
To remoce a file from Git, you have to remove it from your tracked files and the commit - **git rm (odstrani i ze slozky)**
To remove from Git but keep in the working folder - **git rm --cached file_name**

==== Moving Files ====
**git mv file_from file_to**

==== Viewing the Commit History ====
To show history of commits - **git log**
To show the difference in each commit - **git log -p**
